# Ben's Accessibility Software

‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer:** This project was created by a caregiver with no formal programming background.  
Most of the code was generated with **AI assistance (ChatGPT)** and refined through testing.  
It is **not professional-grade software**, but an **open-source example** of what families and caregivers can achieve using AI to build bespoke accessibility tools.  

---

## Overview

This project was developed for **Ben**, who lives with **TUBB4A-related Leukodystrophy (H-ABC)** and uses only two switches (head left/right) to interact with his computer.  

It gives Ben the ability to:  
- Communicate using a **robust predictive text keyboard**  
- Speak **quick communication phrases** from a customizable list  
- Watch and navigate his favorite shows and movies  
- Play simple games  
- Access trivia and word challenges  
- Control his computer with system and emergency functions  

The project is shared openly to inspire others to build similar accessibility tools.
